    "Description": "What does this mod do? Simply put, it increases your perk slots by 1 slot every 10 rounds starting on round 10.\r\n\r\nIt also adds perks that aren't usually in the wunderfizz into the wunderfizz. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, please feel free to report any bugs. This is basically my first mod. I'd be surprised if it didn't bug out honestly...",
